# Simulated Coretime Environment

The purpose of this directory is to consolidate all the necessary components for testing RegionX functionality in one place. This repository offers zombienet scripts, simplifying the process of spinning up the required chains for testing.

### Topology

The local environment consists of three chains:

-   Rococo relay chain
-   Coretime parachain
-   Swanky parachain (NOTE: This can be replaced by any parachain that supports WASM contracts)

### Getting started with Zombienet

To run the local environment, we will first need to get all the necessary binaries.

If we only want to test functionality that is not related to any of the contracts, we can simply run the minimal_network.toml zombienet script:

```
# This will only run the Rococo relay chain and the Coretime chain
./scripts/minimal_init.sh

./zombienet-linux -p native spawn ./zombienet/minimal_network.toml
```

In case we want to run the full local network, which will allow us to test the contracts as well, the following commands need to be run instead:

```
./scripts/full_init.sh

./zombienet-linux -p native spawn ./zombienet/full_network.toml
```

### Getting started with Chopsticks

The Coretime chain is already deployed on Rococo (ðŸ¥³) so that allows us to use Chopsticks for parts of the local testing.

The steps to run a Coretime chain locally and setup the mock environment:

```
npm i

# This will run a parallel copy of the Coretime chain
npm run chopsticks

# In a new terminal:

# This will add some mock data to the Coretime chain
npm run chopsticks-init
```
